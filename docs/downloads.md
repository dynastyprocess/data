## Databases

[**DynastyProcess.com Database**](/downloads/database) - an attempt to aggregate all possible sources of dynasty-relevant player-data. Also good for linking player IDs! 

[**FantasyPros Weekly Scrapes**](/downloads/fpscrapes) - this is a weekly scrape of FantasyPros ECR pages - eventually to be used for tracking risers and fallers!

## Player Values

[**Market Values**](/downloads/values) - this is the classic set of DynastyDashboard values posted as a Google Sheet. Assumes standard dynasty formats. Algorithm is given so that you can tweak it to your liking - although no promises that your liking will match your leaguemates. Can be linked to other Google Sheets via IMPORTRANGE. 

[**Trade Calculator**](/downloads/calculator) - this is a simple Google Sheets-based trade calculator based on the Market Values sheet. 

## Draft/Auction Tools

**[Startup Auction Helper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJVXGFDVX4VDdc23Hlv6kRYzy9x0727hbZOERRoVY9U/copy)** - a Google Sheet designed to estimate approximate auction value of a player based on Market Values and amount of remaining budget. Inspired by [u/slodanslodan](http://www.reddit.com/u/slodanslodan)'s sheet (all I did was tie it to my values sheet). 

**[Rookie Draft Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvFHSQPlxZyJP5l_CbmKXCDURIOqVzlpmSgM5wxQvKQ/copy)** - a Google sheet designed to help run an offline chat-based rookie draft (for the poor schmucks still on ESPN or Yahoo.) Keeps track of picks and crosses off names as players are taken. Set to view-only and share with league so that everyone's on the same page. 

**[Rookie Auction Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TqGKcoJHTQqtC6pBBlKsDd8g24BVBkpsfug6z0QyK10/copy)** - similar to Rookie Draft Tracker but for rookie auctions held on a chat server. Keeps track of budget and players taken, set to view-only and share with league. No timer function is included - not a lot of great ways to do that cleanly, but I can work on it if someone really needs help. 

## League Analysis Tools
**[Potential Points Calculators](/downloads/potentialpoints)** - Excel sheets I built to help calculate Potential Points for ESPN and Yahoo leagues. Requires Excel for Windows and PowerQuery. 

**[Win Probability Tools](/downloads/winprobability)** - an Excel sheet I built as a fun experiment to help guess at expected regular-season finishes in MFL leagues. Uses All-Play Win Percentage as an estimate of team strength. 

## News
**[Slack Aggregator](/downloads/slack)** - a Slack Channel I made that aggregates RSS feeds for NFL news, draft/film prospects, stats/data analytics, and more.

More to come!
