# About

If you haven't heard me wax poetic about using potential points as being the best way to determine draft order, you're probably lucky :smirk:

In any case, these Excel sheets are made to help you calculate potential points for ESPN and Yahoo leagues (tested for 2018). 

**They require Excel for Windows and the PowerQuery plugin**. If you're not sure what that is, check out [ExcelCampus's guide here](https://www.excelcampus.com/install-power-query/).
