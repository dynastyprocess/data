# Apps

(aka *the SHINY!*)

Joe Sydlowski ([@JoeSydlowskiFF](http://twitter.com/JoeSydlowskiFF)) has done some incredible work building web apps using DynastyProcess data.

### Database Browser

Web App: [apps.dynastyprocess.com/database](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/database)

Details: [main Database info page](/database)

This app creates a much more user-friendly way to browse the rapidly-growing DynastyProcess database - making it very simple to drill down to the columns and rows that you might be interested in. It is automatically updated when the database is updated.

### Arbitrage

Web App: [apps.dynastyprocess.com/arbitrage](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/arbitrage)

Details: [main Arbitrage App info page](/arbitrage)

This app uses a Euclidean distance algorithm to help find the most comparable players based on criteria selected from the DynastyProcess database. Again, automatically updated when database is updated.

### Calculator

Web App: [apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator)

Details: [main Calculator info page](/calculator)

A new web-app version of the previous "Google Sheet" calculator, it features sliders to adjust depth weight and rookie values.
