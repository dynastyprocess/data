He has practiced on a limited basis all week and has been listed as questionable. With the Chargers operating as a run-heavy team and Johnston's volatility factored in, I can't trust him as a flex option this week. Johnston hasn't had more than 53 receiving yards in a game since Week 4. Since Week 5, he has finished as a top 24 receiver in weekly scoring only once. Could he burn me this week against Dallas? It's possible, as Dallas has allowed the eighth-most PPR points per target and the seventh-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers since Week 10. Still, it's also tough to depend on Johnston this week with his track record and in a passing offense that, since Week 14, has had the seventh-lowest neutral passing rate.",NA,NA,"WR90","F","5.0"
