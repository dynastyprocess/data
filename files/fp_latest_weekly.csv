Bateman has a 13% target share, a 21.1% air-yard share, 23 receiving yards per game, 1.03 yards per route run, and a 12.7% first-read share. He is third on the team in deep targets, and that's where his upside comes into play this week. Minnesota has recently struggled to defend perimeter wide receivers and deep passing. If Lamar Jackson hits Bateman on a downfield target or two, it could help him pay off as a flex option this week. Since Week 5, Minnesota has allowed the most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers and the second-highest deep completion rate and deep passing yards per game.",NA,NA,"WR53","C-","7.3"

Last week, in the first half, Hollins had a 42.9% route share that bumped to 57.9% in the second half. Yes, Kyle Williams had a 68.4% route share in the second half of the same game, but Hollins has been involved all season long, while that was the first game that Williams played more than 28.6% of the offensive snaps. Overall, Hollins has had 47.7% route share, an 8.9% target share, 1.38 yards per route run, and a 12% first-read share. Hollins is fourth on the team in red zone targets (four) and has logged two deep targets. It's really the coverage matchup that I want to highlight here, and why Hollins could see more action this week. This week, he faces a Tampa Bay secondary that, since Week 5, has utilized two high at the third-highest rate (61.4%). Against two high, Hollins ranks second on the team with an 18% target per route run rate and 0.48 fantasy points per route run, and first in yards per route run with 2.12. Since Week 5, Tampa Bay has allowed the third-most fantasy points per game and the second-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.
