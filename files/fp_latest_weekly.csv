He's dealing with a stress fracture in his foot. He didn't play last week. I have a hard time believing that he will be a full go this week with the foot still a serious issue. I also won't rule out that he will be out this week. Odunze is the WR29 in fantasy points per game, ranking first in deep targets and 21st in red zone targets among wide receivers. Odunze has a 21.9% target share with 55.1 receiving yards per game, 1.83 yards per route run, and a 26.2% first-read share. This week, he faces a Cleveland secondary that has the highest single high rate in the NFL (66.6%). Against single high, Odunze has led the team with a 22.5% target share while posting 1.79 yards per route run and a 24.8% first-read share. Since Week 10, Cleveland has allowed the second-fewest PPR points per target and the fewest receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers, but it'll help that Denzel Ward is out this week. Odunze is just a flex play this week with the matchup and health concerns.",NA,NA,"WR88","F","4.9"

With the limited weekly raw volume now, Waller is a touchdown-or-bust streaming option. In his last two games, he has one red zone target and two deep targets. Waller is best left on the bench this week. Since Week 9, Pittsburgh has allowed the fifth-fewest yards per target, the 11th-fewest receiving yards per game, and the 11th-fewest fantasy points per game to tight ends.","sit",NA,"TE22","D-","8.3"

He turned his four targets into only one reception for seven yards. The lack of passing volume in this offense makes Gadsden a tough player to trust in any format. Since Week 11, Kansas City has had the third-highest two-high rate (62.2%). Since Week 6, against two high, Gadsden has ranked second on the team with a 17.8% target share with 2.08 yards per route run (leads the team) and a 20% first-read share. Gadsden is in the streaming/low-end TE1 area code this week, and that's probably a rosier outlook than he deserves, but the matchup is nice.
