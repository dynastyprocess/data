Since Week 14, Hampton has generated a wonderful 9.1% explosive run rate, but he has only had a 14% missed tackle rate and 1.50 yards after contact per attempt. With many runs, unless he can find daylight, he's simply getting what is blocked. Hampton could produce as a solid RB2 this week despite the tough matchup with his volume and touchdown equity in the offense.
