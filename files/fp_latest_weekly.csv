The lack of targets for Kamara is so frustrating, especially when considering how much Spencer Rattler is chucking it weekly. Kamara should be a focal point of the passing attack, but he has two targets in 50% of his games this season. Kamara's per-touch efficiency isn't great, but that's been the case for the last few seasons outside of the passing game. He has a 14% missed tackle rate and only 1.75 yards after contact per attempt. Kamara should have a resurgent week against the Giants, who can't stop anyone on the ground.

Sean Tucker could steal a few touches, but I don't think his workload is projectable enough to warrant him being a flex play this week. White has a horrible matchup incoming. Seattle has been quite good this season at stopping the run, giving up the sixth-fewest rushing yards per game, the second-lowest explosive run rate, and allowing the third-fewest yards after contact per attempt.

Last week, he was second to Trey Benson in route share with 29.4%. He played 39.1% of the snaps but only had two carries. Last year, while he had a 20.4% route share, he had only 6.8% of the rushing volume. He could easily break a big run this week and pay off with the early down volume he is given. Last year, in limited action (24 carries), he looked very good with a 12.5% explosive run rate, a 21% missed tackle rate, and 3.58 yards after contact per attempt. Tennessee has allowed the fifth-most rushing yards per game, the fourth-highest explosive run rate, and the 13th-highest yards after contact per attempt.
