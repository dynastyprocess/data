He was all over the field against the Bengals and will be one of the most talked about IDP names all week. We are advised not to chase turnovers in IDP leagues, but this was head-turning nonetheless. For his part, Rodgers has recorded three or more solos in every contest this season and had a tackle for loss in each of his first two contests. His showing put him on the CB1 map in CB leagues, but he also warrants some DB3/4 love, especially during the byes. Add Rodgers to rosters where needed, especially in deeper formats.","start","streak","CB23",NA,"11.5"
