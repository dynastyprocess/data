White should handle the bulk of the work this week while having bellcow upside. Sean Tucker could steal a few touches, but I don't think his workload is projectable enough to warrant him being a flex play this week. White has a horrible matchup incoming. Seattle has been quite good this season at stopping the run, giving up the sixth-fewest rushing yards per game, the second-lowest explosive run rate, and allowing the third-fewest yards after contact per attempt. White could make up for a lack of production in the rushing department with his receiving role this week. Last year, among 45 qualifying backs, he was still a solid receiving option, ranking 24th in target per route run rate (21%), 18th in yards per route run (1.44), and 21st in first downs per route run (0.066).
