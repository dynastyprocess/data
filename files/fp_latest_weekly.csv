Walker tied for the team lead with four red zone rushing attempts and led the way with a 40.7% snap rate, a 30.8% route share, and a 46.2% red zone snap share. In the first half, Walker had a 57.1% snap share while Charbonnet had a 28.6% snap rate inside the 20-yard line. Seattle won't run away with this week's game, so we can cancel out last week's George Holani blip. Based on these numbers, I do think that positive regression is coming for Walker, and it could be this week. Among 64 qualifying backs, Walker ranks seventh in explosive run rate and fifth in missed tackle rate. This week, he faces a Rams run defense that, since Week 6, has allowed the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt, the ninth-highest success rate, the 11th-highest yards per carry to gap runs, the seventh-highest success rate to gap runs, and has logged the 13th-lowest stuff rate.
