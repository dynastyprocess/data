Flott has now recorded three or more solos in each of his last three games, which puts him on radars, while the pick makes him an add in CB leagues. Those in DB leagues will want to stash him where needed, but keep him glued to the pine for Week 7 despite the plus matchup against the Denver Broncos. Look elsewhere for your Week 7 DB3/4.",NA,NA,"CB47",NA,"11.1"
