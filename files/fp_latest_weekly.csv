Yes, if you don't know who Jennings is, that's ok. Let's have a conversation about him. Jennings is a 24-year-old undrafted second-year back out of Florida A&M. At his pro day, he ran a 4.66 40-yard dash time. At Florida A&M, he never had more than 673 rushing yards or seven receptions in a season. Now, that doesn't mean he didn't have a productive career. In his final collegiate season, among 290 qualifying FBS/FCS backs, he ranked sixth in yards after contact per attempt, 37th in breakaway percentage, and tenth in elusive rating. Jennings is a talented back despite his unheralded status. He doesn't have a long resume in the regular season in the NFL, but in the preseason over the last two years, he has tallied 3.44 yards after contact per attempt (18 carries). Jennings could split the backfield work with TreVeyon Henderson this week in a good matchup. We don't know how the workload will be split between these two players, with New England hesitant all season to give Henderson a big workload.
