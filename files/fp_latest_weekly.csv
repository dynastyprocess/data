There's no way around that, and if Jackson can't supplement his struggling passing production with rushing equity, it's tough to trust him in fantasy. Now, as I write this, watch Jackson go out and have a massive bounce-back game against a struggling defense in a divisional game and spike everything I just said in my face. That's the risk of benching Jackson this week, but we can also say that he hasn't played well over the last four games.

Since Week 12, Jeudy has had a 15.2% target share with 32.5 receiving yards per game, 1.55 yards per route run, and a 23.1% first-read share. In those two games, Jeudy has led the team with three deep targets. The Titans have struggled to defend perimeter wide receivers and downfield passing. Since Week 9, Tennessee has allowed the third-highest deep ball completion rate, the second-most deep passing yards per game, and the third-highest deep passer rating. Also, since Week 9, Tennessee has allowed the seventh-highest PPR points per target and the seventh-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.","start","matchup","WR47","C-","8.7"

Kincaid has been mashing on a per-route basis with 3.37 yards per route run, but the issue is that he has only a 47% route share. I'd love to tell you that I LOVE HIM this week versus the Bengals, who have bled out production to tight ends all year and are easily the best matchup in the NFL for the position, but I have my worries. Kincaid has been a limited snap player all season, and in Weeks 8-9, he had only 32% and 46.7% route shares. In those two games, he had only three and six targets. It's tough to expect him to be ridiculously efficient and produce on limited volume when he is clearly not 100%. Could he pay off for fantasy this week? Sure. Are there a ton of concerns around his playing, efficiency, and the Bills' game plan this week? Oh, hell yes. If Buffalo wants to just lean on their run game, they can against Cincy.
