He directed a passing offense that had the fourth-lowest neutral passing rate and the 15th-slowest neutral pace. The play volume for Darnold isn't likely to be there weekly if this offense continues to operate this way to be anything more than a low-end QB2 unless they fall into a hole and Seattle is forced to pass a ton. Last week, Darnold ranked 17th in yards per attempt, 20th in passer rating, 25th in highly accurate throw rate, and 17th in catchable target rate. Pittsburgh's pass defense was horrible last week. They have too much talent on this side of the ball to continue to look this bad on defense, but I don't know if they'll turn it around this week. Last week, they allowed the third-highest success rate per dropback, the fifth-highest passer rating, and the highest CPOE. If the Steelers truly are this awful again this week, Darnold could see an uptick in his per-dropback efficiency and climb the QB2 ranks.",NA,NA,"QB28","F","14.6"

Last week, he played 31% of the snaps and had six carries, which he turned into nine yards on the ground. His mediocre per-carry efficiency is already manifesting itself again in 2025, as he didn't force a single missed tackle and had only 1.17 yards after contact per attempt. The matchup is good for Allen on the ground, but you're likely praying for another score if you put him in your flex. Last year, Buffalo allowed the eighth-highest missed tackle rate, the 12th-most yards after contact per attempt, and the ninth-highest yards before contact per attempt.","sit",NA,"RB39","D+","8.1"

He had a 36.8% running back rushing share, a 38.2% route share, and a 13.3% target share. Gainwell only managed a 14% missed tackle rate and 2.0 yards after contact per attempt. I wouldn't plug Gainwell into any lineup, as it wouldn't surprise me if Warren took over more of the work or if Kaleb Johnson also entered the backfield equation this week. This is an absolute and total mess.

It's unlikely that he continues to see a target per route run rate that high, so unless he sees an uptick in routes, his usage is likely to come crashing back to Earth. Cleveland also utilized two tight end sets with 50.7% (second-highest in the NFL) of their offensive plays in Week 1. That's a big difference from their 16.5% (tenth-lowest) snap usage of the same personnel grouping last season. I would sit Fannin Jr. this week to see how his usage shakes out, but I know that's likely not the world that many people are living in after Week 1 with a BEVY of tight end injuries hitting fantasy teams.

He was the TE1 in fantasy in Week 1. I don't think that continues obviously, but it was an awesome start for Johnson, who looks to play a big role for this team in 2025. Johnson is a strong tight end streaming option this week despite a tough matchup. He should see plenty of volume to help outkick the matchup.
