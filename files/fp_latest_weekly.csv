I don't care if it's Superflex or not. He was a sitting duck last week and honestly looked lost. He finished Week 1 with a 45.9% completion rate, 4.5 yards per attempt, and a 59.3 passer rating. This is all while he also sustained the fourth-highest pressure rate. Dallas held Philly to 6.6 yards per attempt and the 13th-lowest CPOE. I expect Wilson to be under duress again this week against a Dallas front that led the NFL in pressure rate in Week 1. Wilson might get pulled at some point for Jaxson Dart. While I hope it doesn't happen (for Dart's sake), I can't rule it out.","sit",NA,"QB28","F","14.5"

The play volume for Darnold isn't likely to be there weekly if this offense continues to operate this way to be anything more than a low-end QB2 unless they fall into a hole and Seattle is forced to pass a ton. Last week, Darnold ranked 17th in yards per attempt, 20th in passer rating, 25th in highly accurate throw rate, and 17th in catchable target rate. Pittsburgh's pass defense was horrible last week. They have too much talent on this side of the ball to continue to look this bad on defense, but I don't know if they'll turn it around this week. Last week, they allowed the third-highest success rate per dropback, the fifth-highest passer rating, and the highest CPOE.

Among 47 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranked 35th in yards per attempt, 36th in passer rating, 37th in CPOE, and 31st in catchable target rate. Surprisingly enough, among the same set of quarterbacks, he ranked eighth in highly accurate throw rate. Jones is a decent QB2 play this week, considering the offensive ecosystem and his matchup.

Unless his routes increase, he likely won't see that much work in the passing game weekly. He had eight targets while running only 14 routes. Sampson has to run more routes weekly, or his target count will drop because that target per route run rate isn't replicable. He was effective on the ground with a 25% missed tackle rate despite having only 2.4 yards per carry. His offensive line is more to blame, though, as they generated only 0.25 yards before contact per attempt for him. Sampson will have to rack up his production in Week 2 through the air again, as Baltimore is a top-shelf run defense. In Week 1, they allowed the 14th-lowest explosive run rate, the fourth-lowest missed tackle rate, and the third-lowest yards after contact per attempt.

Brown was a ghost in Week 1. He had only one target (4.3% target share), eight receiving yards, and a 10% first-read share. He had only one first read target, which is not like Brown. I don't want to play injury conspiracy theorist here, but I don't think Brown is fully healthy based on his Week 1 usage and the fact that he failed to record a single route win (31 routes). Plugging Brown into your lineups in Week 2 is a risk. There's no doubt about it. We have a one-game nightmare fuel sample to work off of. Playing him just comes down to your other options at the wide receiver position. Facing the Kansas City secondary could work in his favor if they don't improve their play in Week 2.

He ran 40% of his routes from the slot. All of these numbers are concerning for Thielen entering Week 2. Thielen looks like the very distant fourth target in this offense right now behind Justin Jefferson, T.J. Hockenson, and probably Aaron Jones. His 0.200 separation score and 20% route win rate in Week 1 are both very solid marks, so I don't think he's just suddenly cooked. Last week, A.J. Terrell followed Mike Evans on nearly 55% of his routes, so Justin Jefferson could get this treatment in Week 2. This would leave Thielen matching up with Mike Hughes (2024: 67.2% catch rate and 98.7 passer rating allowed) and Billy Bowman Jr. (50% catch rate and 64.6 passer rating allowed) for most of the day. Atlanta did give up the eighth-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers in Week 1, so there's a silver lining here.

This could be another quiet week for him against a tough secondary, but Fantasy GMs should not be dropping him in any league and should be trading for/picking him up off waivers where possible. The Rams are no pushover secondary. In Week, they allowed the 11th-fewest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.

Fannin Jr. had only a 60.2% route share and a ridiculous 31% target per route run rate. Both of those usage metrics scream regression. It's unlikely that he continues to see a target per route run rate that high, so unless he sees an uptick in routes, his usage is likely to come crashing back to Earth. Cleveland also utilized two tight end sets with 50.7% (second-highest in the NFL) of their offensive plays in Week 1. That's a big difference from their 16.5% (tenth-lowest) snap usage of the same personnel grouping last season.
