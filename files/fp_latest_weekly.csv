Mayfield's passing touchdowns could regress some in 2025, as he had 41 last year, when he had never eclipsed 30 before. Now, that doesn't mean his passing touchdowns will drop back into the 20s, but I do expect him to finish somewhere in the mid-30s. Another area where Mayfield could see some regression is in the rushing department. Last year, he finished with 378 rushing yards (10th-best) and three rushing scores (12th-best). Both of those figures were also career highs. I'm not trying to take anything away from Mayfield because he was studly on a per-dropback basis. Among 40 qualifying quarterbacks, he was seventh in yards per attempt and CPOE and second in highly accurate throw rate (per Fantasy Points Data). Mayfield should have a strong game out of the gate. Last year, Atlanta allowed the second-most passing touchdowns, the fourth-highest passer rating, and the fifth-highest CPOE to quarterbacks. With Jeff Ulbrich as the new defensive coordinator, they should remain two-high heavy. In two of Ulbrich's last three seasons calling defensive plays, he has ranked in the top ten in two high usage (fifth and tenth, 51.7-54.3% of snaps). This also matches well with Atlanta, which was 12th in two high usage last year (50.3%).

With Lou Anarumo taking over the Colts' defensive playcalling this year, I expect that we'll still see a ton of single high usage. Last year, Indy was 11th in single high rate (56.2%). In two of Anarumo's final three seasons with Cincy, he utilized single high between 53.9-59.8% of snaps. Last year, Tagovailoa ranked 11th in passer rating and CPOE and tenth in fantasy points per dropback against single high. Last season, in Weeks 10-18, Indy allowed the seventh-highest success rate per dropback, the tenth-highest yards per attempt, and ranked 14th in EPA per dropback, but I'll say that not only did they change defensive coordinators, they added a new starting corner duo. Charvarius Ward and Xavien Howard take over on the perimeter this season, which will hopefully be upgrades for the Colts. This is a middle-of-the-road matchup for Tagovailoa.",NA,NA,"QB23","D","15.6"

Among 47 qualifying quarterbacks last season, he ranked 16th in yards per attempt, 23rd in CPOE, 43rd in highly accurate throw rate, and 21st in catchable target rate. Penix isn't a rushing threat, with no more than five rushing yards in any of his starts last year, so he'll have to rack up all of his fantasy scoring from the pocket. If this game shoots out (likely), Penix could be pressed into a heavier passing game script than Atlanta might want and post a juicy stat line. Last year, Tampa Bay had the sixth-highest single high rate (59.5%). Against single-high, Penix ranked eighth in yards per attempt and fifth in CPOE.

It wasn't all glitz and glam for Flacco, though, as his accuracy metrics were absolutely horrendous. Among that same sample of passers, he was 42nd in CPOE, 28th in highly accurate throw rate, and 39th in catchable target rate. He also finished with the 14th-highest turnover-worthy throw rate. I think we'll see a similar version of Flacco in 2025 from an inaccuracy standpoint. We'll see if the fantasy production is there, but I have my questions. Flacco has a solid matchup on paper against the Bengals in Week 1, but there are some concerns. With Trey Hendrickson good to go, the pass rush should be decent. Quietly, last year, Cincy ranked 12th in pressure rate and fourth in quarterback knockdown rate. Adding Shemar Stewart to that pass rush equation could yield some nice results.

Among 40 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranked 13th in yards per attempt, fourth in CPOE, and tenth in highly accurate throw rate. The wheels came off for Smith when he was pressured, and that happened often in 2024 as he faced the sixth-most pressures in the NFL. Last year, when pressured, Smith ranked 35th in passer rating with the fourth-highest turnover-worthy throw rate while sitting at 17th in adjusted completion rate. When Smith passed from a clean pocket, he ranked 13th in passer rating, had the 23rd-lowest turnover-worthy throw rate, and was second in adjusted completion rate. The move from Seattle to Las Vegas could benefit Smith's pressure sensitivity greatly, as the Raiders were 14th in pass blocking grade last season (Seattle 19th). The Patriots will have an improved pass rush this season. The question is how much. Last year, New England had the fourth-lowest pressure rate. The additions of Harold Landry, Robert Spillane, and K'Lavon Chaisson will help the team improve upon last year's mark. Smith should still have time in the pocket to operate this week, though. Last season, New England also ranked 15th in yards per attempt while giving up the third-highest CPOE and seventh-highest passer rating.

Despite those rousing stats I mentioned a second ago, Darnold was also 22nd in highly accurate throw rate, 15th in catchable target rate, and he had the ninth-highest turnover-worthy throw rate. Darnold could post decent QB2 numbers this week against a 49ers' secondary that, last year, in Weeks 10-18, allowed the sixth-most passing touchdowns, the 11th-highest CPOE, and the second-highest passer rating.

Yes, Pittsburgh (fourth-lowest passing rate over expectation) will pass more in 2025, but they WILL NOT be a top 5-10 passing rate team. Then we are left to rely upon per-dropback efficiency from Rodgers, which in the year 2025 is hard to do.

Rodgers faces his former team in Week 1, which last year (in Weeks 10-18) allowed the 13th-highest yards per attempt, the tenth-highest passer rating, and the third-highest CPOE. Now, I'm taking those numbers with a grain of salt, given that Aaron Glenn is now at the controls of this defense. The Jets looked like a team that had given up in the back half of last season, so I expect a renewed fire from them and their defense to play closer to expectation, with consideration of the talent on that side of the ball for New York.

I'm tossing all of the Cardinals' run defense metrics in the trash. Arizona will field a rebuilt defensive line that looks ready to stop the run at a strong clip this season.

In two of his last four seasons in college, Henderson ranked top ten in yards after contact per attempt (seventh, eighth) and top 20 in breakaway percentage (10th, 18th). He will operate behind an improved offensive line that added Garrett Bradbury, Will Campbell, and Morgan Moses in the offseason. Henderson should be the favorite for passing down work, which is great news for his floor and ceiling. Across his last two collegiate seasons, Henderson has ranked 21st & 22nd in receiving grade. Josh McDaniels will feature him through the air. In McDaniels' last five full seasons of directing NFL offenses, he has ranked inside the top ten in four of those years, with 20-36.2% of the passing attack flowing through the backfield. The Raiders have a worrisome defensive line assortment when it comes to stopping the run. Last year, Adam Butler (48.3) and Thomas Booker IV (53.6) had run defense grades below 55, and Malcolm Koonce has performed at a similar level in two of his three NFL seasons.

After such a disappointing first year, we're left wondering, entering year two, ""Can Harrison live up to last year's hype and breakout in 2025?"" I'll start by saying I'm doubtful. In Weeks 1-9, Arizona deployed Harrison Jr. primarily as a downfield receiver, with only 29.9% of his routes being horizontal breaking routes and 49.6% of them being vertical breaking routes. In that sample, he drew a 21.4% target share (32nd) with 49.4 receiving yards per game (43rd), a 28.2% first-read share (29th), 0.093 first downs per route run (36th), and 1.97 yards per route run (38th). This was a horrible game plan by Arizona's coaching staff. Last year, Harrison Jr. ranked 84th and 51st in vertical route-breaking separation and route win rate as opposed to 16th and 19th in those categories when it came to horizontal-breaking routes. The good thing for Harrison Jr. is that, in Weeks 10-18, his horizontal route % climbed to 41.4%, while vertical breaking routes made up 38.5% of his usage. The problem is that in Weeks 10-18, his numbers didn't improve; instead, they actually worsened with the usage change. He had a 20.6% target share (33rd), 55 receiving yards per game (37th), a 27.1% first-read share, 0.078 first downs per route run, and 1.56 yards per route run. We'll see what Arizona has cooked up for him this year, beginning with Week 1. Last year, New Orleans utilized two high at the eighth-highest rate (51.7%). In 2024, against two high, Harrison Jr. had a disappointing 20% target per route run rate and 1.53 yards per route run. Last year, the Saints ranked 16th in PPR points per target allowed to perimeter wide receivers.

Yes, Caleb Williams was partially to blame as Moore ranked 55th in catchable target rate, which could partially explain his 1.53 yards per route run (60th), 56.8 receiving yards per game (35th), and 0.068 first downs per route run (67th). It doesn't, however, wipe away his 76th ranking in separation and 59th standing in route win rate. Last year, Minnesota led the NFL in two high rate (63.6%). Last season, among 101 qualifying receivers, Moore ranked 60th and 68th in separation and route win rates against two high. It's tough to feel great about his outlook in Week 1 with the coverage matchup and lining up against Isaiah Rodgers (2024: 50% catch rate and 85.4 passer rating allowed) and Byron Murphy (2024: 70% catch rate and 79.3 passer rating allowed) all game.","sit","matchup","WR23","B+","14.2"

Jalen McMillan sustained a neck injury in the preseason that has also called his availability for a large chunk of this season into question (he could be out until their bye in Week 9). Egbuka looks like he could be the clear WR2 for the Bucs for most of the season, if not all of it. Egbuka's talent has never been in question.

I don't see him being elevated into the head defensive position and rocking the boat when he has been helping curate their defensive system for the last few years. This leads me to think that Detroit will remain single high leaning despite the departure of Aaron Glenn. Over the last three years, Detroit has utilized single high 54.5-57.4%. If we zoom in further, in Weeks 1-12 last year, when Carlton Davis was the healthiest, this defense had the ninth-highest single high rate (56.1%). Why does this matter? Last year, Watson had the highest aDOT on the team (19.0) and ranked second on the team with a 25% target per route run rate against single high. I'm not sure Golden gets fed a ton of targets this week, but they should be high-value targets down the field. If he connects on one or two, he'll have a pretty nice stat line. The Lions have a talented secondary as Golden will match up against Terrion Arnold (2024: 64.2% catch rate and 100.4 passer rating allowed) and D.J.

I'll lead this off by saying that we can toss Allen's yards per route run and first downs per route run in the trash, as every Bears wide receiver's efficiency metrics were tanked last year by Caleb Williams' struggles. Allen finished as the WR31 in fantasy points per game. Among 85 qualifying receivers, he didn't have any issues, still earning volume at a high rate, ranking 20th in target share (23.5%) and 26th in first-read share (28.8%). His route running and separation skills remained solid. Among 112 qualifying receivers, he ranked 45th in separation and 40th in route win rate. Last year, his slot rate dipped slightly to 54%. I expect that to creep back up toward the 60% mark in Los Angeles. Last year, the Chiefs were ripped in half by slot receivers (allowing the most fantasy points per game and the 11th-highest PPR points per target last year). Allen could have a nice volume-fueled day against the Chiefs. Last season, Kansas City had the second-highest two high rate last year (60.9%). In 2024, against two high among 101 qualifying wide receivers, Allen ranked 41st in separation and 48th in route win rate. Those aren't eye-popping numbers, but they are still quite solid. Allen is a strong flex in Week 1, especially in PPR formats.","start",NA,"WR60","D","8.6"

For you deep league degens, I'll still discuss his outlook, though. Johnston had two up and down meetings with Kansas City last year, even as a full-time player with a WR89 finish in the first go around and a kinder WR22 finish in Week 14. Last season, Kansas City had the second-highest two high rate last year (60.9%). In 2024, against two high, Johnston had only a 19% target per route run rate but he managed 2.37 yards per route run rate and a 21.6% first-read share.

Among that same sample, he was 47th in yards per route run and 32nd in target per route run rate.

He finished as the WR6, WR13, and WR62 in weekly scoring in this brief stretch. Zaccheaus will open the 2025 season as the Bears' starting slot receiver.

Last season, against two high, Zaccheaus had a stellar 28% target per route run rate and 0.123 first downs per route run against two high. Add in that Minnesota gave up a ton of production to slot receivers last year, and their new nickel (Tavierre Thomas) isn't a matchup to fear, and we have a perfect storm for Zaccheaus to outperform expectations in Week 1. Last year, Minnesota allowed the fifth-most fantasy points per game and the third-most receiving yards per game to slot receivers. Last season, Thomas defended only five targets, but if we go back to 2023 (his last substantial playing time), he allowed an 82.1% catch rate and 110.6 passer rating in coverage.

Ferguson will likely be a part-time player in his rookie season with a gradual ramp-up, with Ferguson taking over as the team's starting tight end in 2026 when Higbee leaves as a free agent. Higbee should be a full-time player in 2025. Higbee will be a streaming option this year at times, but not in Week 1.
