Among 43 qualifying backs, he ranks 12th in missed tackles forced per attempt and 13th in yards after contact per attempt. Denver should feed both backs this week, as the pressure point of the Eagles' defense is their run defense. Philly has allowed the 12th-most rushing yards per game, the lowest stuff rate, the tenth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 12th-highest yards before contact per attempt. Philly has also surrendered the 11th-highest yards per carry and the third-highest success rate to gap runs (Harvey 51.9% gap). Harvey can also get it down through the air against a defense that has allowed the tenth-most receiving yards and the fourth-highest yards per reception to running backs.","start",NA,"RB28","C","9.3"

The way I'm approaching this is that Michael Carter will be the early down option, and Demercado will handle the two-minute offense and most of the passing downs. Last week, he was second to Trey Benson in route share with 29.4%. He played 39.1% of the snaps but only had two carries. Last year, while he had a 20.4% route share, he had only 6.8% of the rushing volume. He could easily break a big run this week and pay off with the early down volume he is given. Last year, in limited action (24 carries), he looked very good with a 12.5% explosive run rate, a 21% missed tackle rate, and 3.58 yards after contact per attempt. Tennessee has allowed the fifth-most rushing yards per game, the fourth-highest explosive run rate, and the 13th-highest yards after contact per attempt. The Titans are also 17th in receiving yards and 18th in yards per reception allowed to running backs.

He has two games this season with route shares north of 60%, but he has dipped below 50% twice as well. Last week, Horton had a 36.7% route share and only a 7.7% target share. This is too volatile to trust in a flex spot this week. The matchup is horrible for Horton, even if he were a full-time player. Tampa Bay has allowed the fourth-fewest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers. Sit Horton.",NA,NA,"WR56","D","7.4"

He hasn't seen more than five targets in any game nor surpassed 34 yards receiving in a game this season. Johnson has four red zone targets this season, so the usage near the goal line has been there. He has only an 11.5% target share with 0.65 yards per route run and a 12.3% first-read share. Yes, he did have a 30% target share and a 33.3% first-read share last week, once Malik Nabers was out, but it was only a ten-target sample, so I don't want to overweigh last week's sample without Nabers when we have a longer history of Johnson not being a high-end target earner. The Saints are a decent matchup for him, but he's a low-end, touchdown-dependent streaming option. New Orleans has allowed the eighth-highest yards per reception to tight ends while ranking 14th in receiving yards and 16th in fantasy points per game allowed.",NA,NA,"TE21","D-","7.4"
