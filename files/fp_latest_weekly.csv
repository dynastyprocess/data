Hockenson has two TE1 weekly finishes this season, and neither happened with JJ McCarthy under center. With McCarthy chucking the rock, Hockenson's best weekly output was last week as the TE15 for the week. In his seven games with McCarthy under center, Hockenson has had a 13.7% target share (3.6 targets per game) with 16.6 receiving yards per game, 0.74 yards per route run, and a 13.2% first-read share. In those seven games, he has had only two red zone targets and zero deep targets. Hockenson is only a desperation streaming option this week. Dallas has allowed the 13th-most receiving yards and ranked 18th in fantasy points per game allowed to tight ends.",NA,NA,"TE26","F","6.5"
