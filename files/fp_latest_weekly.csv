It's tough to bet on Johnson to make the most of limited volume this week, but if he does get into the end zone, he will be a decent flex play. He's a coin flip in Week 12. I lean more towards sitting him this week, but it depends on your fantasy options. I also worry that Johnson could see his route share dip with Chris Godwin back this week.

He had limited practices for the rest of the week and doesn't carry an injury designation into Week 12. I doubt that his hamstring is 100%, but it is good enough for him to suit up. Since Week 5, Slayton has had a 16.5% target share, a 32.1% air-yard share, 52 receiving yards per game, 2.0 yards per route run, and a 21.5% first-read share. In those four games played, he had one red zone target and six deep targets. He faces a Detroit secondary that has the seventh-highest single high rate (58.2%). Since Week 5, Slayton has led the team with a 26% target per route run rate against single high with 2.05 yards per route run. Those are strong numbers, no matter how you slice it. Slayton is a low-end flex this week with a tough matchup. Since Week 7, Detroit has allowed the second-fewest PPR points per target and the 12th-fewest receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.",NA,NA,"WR85","F","4.1"
