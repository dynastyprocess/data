Last week, Walker had 14 carries and 67 rushing yards. Zach Charbonnet finished with the same number of carries, and he and George Holani got into the end zone. Walker tied for the team lead with four red zone rushing attempts and led the way with a 40.7% snap rate, a 30.8% route share, and a 46.2% red zone snap share. In the first half, Walker had a 57.1% snap share while Charbonnet had a 28.6% snap rate inside the 20-yard line. Seattle won't run away with this week's game, so we can cancel out last week's George Holani blip. Based on these numbers, I do think that positive regression is coming for Walker, and it could be this week. Among 64 qualifying backs, Walker ranks seventh in explosive run rate and fifth in missed tackle rate. This week, he faces a Rams run defense that, since Week 6, has allowed the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt, the ninth-highest success rate, the 11th-highest yards per carry to gap runs, the seventh-highest success rate to gap runs, and has logged the 13th-lowest stuff rate. Walker has been the leader for the team in gap run concepts (44.2%). I'm just as worried about Walker disappointing again this week, but the data is quite positive for him this week. I'll close my eyes and plug him into lineups and trust the process.","start",NA,"RB27","C+","9.6"
