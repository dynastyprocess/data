He's operating as Patrick Mahomes' deep threat, which isn't a bad role to have this week. The Giants have allowed the sixth-most deep passing yards per game and are tied for the 12th-highest deep ball completion rate (adjusted). The Giants also have utilized single-high at the seventh-highest rate (60.6%). Against single high, Thornton leads the team with 2.57 yards per route run and is second with a 24% first-read share. He could easily take a deep target to the house again this week. The Giants have allowed the 11th-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.","start",NA,"WR64","F","8.4"
