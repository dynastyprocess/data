It has been a tough season for Jeudy. With Gabriel under center, Jeudy has had a 15.9% target share, 18.8 receiving yards per game, 0.57 yards per route run, and a 21.6% first-read share. In those four games, he has had six red zone targets and two deep targets. Jeudy could have success this week against a secondary that now doesn't include Michael Carter or Sauce Gardner, but Gabriel's lackluster play will still likely cap his production and upside. Jeudy is a dice roll flex play only. Since Week 5, the Jets have ranked 17th in PPR points per target allowed to perimeter wide receivers.",NA,NA,"WR49","C-","8.3"
