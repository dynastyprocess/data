Since Week 2, Horton has had a 14.8% target share, a 25.6% air-yard share, 2.13 yards per route run (32 receiving yards per game), and a 17.6% first-read share (third on the team). Horton will be in play as a flex option, especially when we get to bye weeks, but I'm not rolling him out there this week.
