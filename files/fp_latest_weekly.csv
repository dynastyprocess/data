Mayfield's passing touchdowns could regress some in 2025, as he had 41 last year, when he had never eclipsed 30 before. Now, that doesn't mean his passing touchdowns will drop back into the 20s, but I do expect him to finish somewhere in the mid-30s. Another area where Mayfield could see some regression is in the rushing department. Last year, he finished with 378 rushing yards (10th-best) and three rushing scores (12th-best). Both of those figures were also career highs. I'm not trying to take anything away from Mayfield because he was studly on a per-dropback basis. Among 40 qualifying quarterbacks, he was seventh in yards per attempt and CPOE and second in highly accurate throw rate (per Fantasy Points Data). Mayfield should have a strong game out of the gate. Last year, Atlanta allowed the second-most passing touchdowns, the fourth-highest passer rating, and the fifth-highest CPOE to quarterbacks. With Jeff Ulbrich as the new defensive coordinator, they should remain two-high heavy. In two of Ulbrich's last three seasons calling defensive plays, he has ranked in the top ten in two high usage (fifth and tenth, 51.7-54.3% of snaps). This also matches well with Atlanta, which was 12th in two high usage last year (50.3%).

Jones is an interesting QB2 option this week in Superflex leagues. While I'm not confident he starts the entire season, Jones should have success in Week 1. This secondary has question marks throughout with the arrival of Minkah Fitzpatrick and their rough starting perimeter duo of Rasul Douglas (2024: 72.6% catch rate and 116.9 passer rating allowed) and Storm Duck (2024: 71.9% catch rate and 104.2 passer rating allowed). Their pass rush had the tenth-lowest pressure rate last year, but that can be explained by Jaelan Phillips being limited to four games and no Bradley Chubb last season.

He was extremely aggressive, ranking sixth in deep throw rate, fourth in hero throw rate, and second in aDOT. Among 47 qualifying quarterbacks last season, he ranked 16th in yards per attempt, 23rd in CPOE, 43rd in highly accurate throw rate, and 21st in catchable target rate. Penix isn't a rushing threat, with no more than five rushing yards in any of his starts last year, so he'll have to rack up all of his fantasy scoring from the pocket. If this game shoots out (likely), Penix could be pressed into a heavier passing game script than Atlanta might want and post a juicy stat line. Last year, Tampa Bay had the sixth-highest single high rate (59.5%). Against single-high, Penix ranked eighth in yards per attempt and fifth in CPOE.

Stafford's back issues are hanging over his head like a black cloud. We'll see if he can hold up for the entire season once the hits start piling up, but he sounds like he's good to go for Week 1. Stafford has a mighty test in Week 1 against a talented Houston pass defense. Last year, in Weeks 10-18, Houston forced the most interceptions, allowed the third-lowest success rate per dropback, and the sixth-lowest CPOE.

Among that same sample of passers, he was 42nd in CPOE, 28th in highly accurate throw rate, and 39th in catchable target rate. He also finished with the 14th-highest turnover-worthy throw rate. I think we'll see a similar version of Flacco in 2025 from an inaccuracy standpoint. We'll see if the fantasy production is there, but I have my questions. Flacco has a solid matchup on paper against the Bengals in Week 1, but there are some concerns. With Trey Hendrickson good to go, the pass rush should be decent. Quietly, last year, Cincy ranked 12th in pressure rate and fourth in quarterback knockdown rate. Adding Shemar Stewart to that pass rush equation could yield some nice results.

Among 40 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranked 13th in yards per attempt, fourth in CPOE, and tenth in highly accurate throw rate. The wheels came off for Smith when he was pressured, and that happened often in 2024 as he faced the sixth-most pressures in the NFL. Last year, when pressured, Smith ranked 35th in passer rating with the fourth-highest turnover-worthy throw rate while sitting at 17th in adjusted completion rate. When Smith passed from a clean pocket, he ranked 13th in passer rating, had the 23rd-lowest turnover-worthy throw rate, and was second in adjusted completion rate. The move from Seattle to Las Vegas could benefit Smith's pressure sensitivity greatly, as the Raiders were 14th in pass blocking grade last season (Seattle 19th). The Patriots will have an improved pass rush this season. The question is how much. Last year, New England had the fourth-lowest pressure rate. The additions of Harold Landry, Robert Spillane, and K'Lavon Chaisson will help the team improve upon last year's mark. Smith should still have time in the pocket to operate this week, though. Last season, New England also ranked 15th in yards per attempt while giving up the third-highest CPOE and seventh-highest passer rating. The addition of Carlton Davis will have something to say about that in 2025, but until we see them perform this should be considered only a middle-of-the-road matchup until we have seen the on field product perform.",NA,NA,"QB27","F","15.0"

Despite those rousing stats I mentioned a second ago, Darnold was also 22nd in highly accurate throw rate, 15th in catchable target rate, and he had the ninth-highest turnover-worthy throw rate. Darnold could post decent QB2 numbers this week against a 49ers' secondary that, last year, in Weeks 10-18, allowed the sixth-most passing touchdowns, the 11th-highest CPOE, and the second-highest passer rating.

Yes, Pittsburgh (fourth-lowest passing rate over expectation) will pass more in 2025, but they WILL NOT be a top 5-10 passing rate team. Then we are left to rely upon per-dropback efficiency from Rodgers, which in the year 2025 is hard to do. Last season, among 40 qualifying passers, he ranked 29th in yards per attempt, 39th in CPOE, 22nd in catchable target rate, and had the eighth-highest off-target rate. Rodgers faces his former team in Week 1, which last year (in Weeks 10-18) allowed the 13th-highest yards per attempt, the tenth-highest passer rating, and the third-highest CPOE. Now, I'm taking those numbers with a grain of salt, given that Aaron Glenn is now at the controls of this defense. The Jets looked like a team that had given up in the back half of last season, so I expect a renewed fire from them and their defense to play closer to expectation, with consideration of the talent on that side of the ball for New York.

I'm tossing all of the Cardinals' run defense metrics in the trash. Arizona will field a rebuilt defensive line that looks ready to stop the run at a strong clip this season.

If we zoom in further, in Weeks 1-3 with Sanders, Hubbard had three red zone rushing attempts while Sanders checked in with two. Hubbard remains an electric early down rusher. Last year, he ranked 11th in explosive run rate and seventh in yards after contact per attempt. Rico Dowdle will likely eat into his workload this season, beginning in Week 1. If Hubbard falls into the endzone against Jacksonville, he'll likely pay off as an RB2.

We'll have to see how that plays out early this season before we can get a full understanding of TreVeyon Henderson's weekly expected touch count. Even if he is more limited out of the gate, Henderson has the per-touch explosiveness to make the most of his opportunities. In two of his last four seasons in college, Henderson ranked top ten in yards after contact per attempt (seventh, eighth) and top 20 in breakaway percentage (10th, 18th). He will operate behind an improved offensive line that added Garrett Bradbury, Will Campbell, and Morgan Moses in the offseason. Henderson should be the favorite for passing down work, which is great news for his floor and ceiling. Across his last two collegiate seasons, Henderson has ranked 21st & 22nd in receiving grade. Josh McDaniels will feature him through the air. In McDaniels' last five full seasons of directing NFL offenses, he has ranked inside the top ten in four of those years, with 20-36.2% of the passing attack flowing through the backfield.

McConkey could cede more of the two high work to Keenan Allen this year. His role as the team's slot receiver is also likely to take a hit with Allen back on the roster. Last year, McConkey had a 69.3% slot rate, which is sure to decline. The real question is how much? This matters a ton for Week 1 in particular. Last year, Kansas City allowed the fewest fantasy points per game and the eighth-fewest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers. Now, I will also say that they were eaten alive by slot receivers (allowing the most fantasy points per game and the 11th-highest PPR points per target last year). If McConkey and Allen rotate in and out of the slot, McConkey can still walk away with a solid day despite my concerns.

Last year, his separation (0.035 vs. 0.068) and route win rate (9.4% vs. 10.4%) were notably worse as a perimeter wide receiver, while also noting that his overall numbers in these metrics were surprisingly poor. Overall, among 112 qualifying receivers, he ranked 62nd in separation score and 88th in route win rate. If Klint Kubiak deploys a system similar to what he did in New Orleans last year, Smith-Njigba's slot rate is sure to decline. Last year, New Orleans had the second-lowest rate of three wide receiver sets in the NFL (33%). If we want to look at the glass as half full, Smith-Njigba will see a lot of two high in Week 1.

Last year, against two high, Smith-Njigba had a 24% target per route run rate, 2.23 yards per route run, and 0.110 first downs per route run.

McLaurin was quite good last season against single high with 2.42 yards per route run, a 24.8% first-read share, and 0.101 first downs per route run.

With Kliff Kingsbury, McLaurin lined up as the LWR with 73% of his snaps last year, which means he'll see Banks for most of the day. Last year, Banks played RCB on 63% of his snaps. Week 1 should be quite generous for McLaurin.","start",NA,"WR18","A-","14.9"

After such a disappointing first year, we're left wondering, entering year two, ""Can Harrison live up to last year's hype and breakout in 2025?"" I'll start by saying I'm doubtful. In Weeks 1-9, Arizona deployed Harrison Jr. primarily as a downfield receiver, with only 29.9% of his routes being horizontal breaking routes and 49.6% of them being vertical breaking routes. In that sample, he drew a 21.4% target share (32nd) with 49.4 receiving yards per game (43rd), a 28.2% first-read share (29th), 0.093 first downs per route run (36th), and 1.97 yards per route run (38th). This was a horrible game plan by Arizona's coaching staff. Last year, Harrison Jr. ranked 84th and 51st in vertical route-breaking separation and route win rate as opposed to 16th and 19th in those categories when it came to horizontal-breaking routes. The good thing for Harrison Jr. is that, in Weeks 10-18, his horizontal route % climbed to 41.4%, while vertical breaking routes made up 38.5% of his usage. The problem is that in Weeks 10-18, his numbers didn't improve; instead, they actually worsened with the usage change. He had a 20.6% target share (33rd), 55 receiving yards per game (37th), a 27.1% first-read share, 0.078 first downs per route run, and 1.56 yards per route run. We'll see what Arizona has cooked up for him this year, beginning with Week 1. Last year, New Orleans utilized two high at the eighth-highest rate (51.7%). In 2024, against two high, Harrison Jr. had a disappointing 20% target per route run rate and 1.53 yards per route run. Last year, the Saints ranked 16th in PPR points per target allowed to perimeter wide receivers.

Also, in 2023-2024, Engram excelled in one of the hallmark metrics that I look at when evaluating talent and upside at the tight end position: yards per route run versus man coverage. In those seasons, Engram ranked fourth and eighth in this metric. Engram still has massive upside in this offense, but his preseason usage is concerning. In the third week of preseason action, he had only a 64% route per dropback rate. If that holds all season, it'll cap his upside in fantasy. I'm unsure that it will.

Last year, among 47 qualifying tight ends, Kraft ranked 20th in target share and 27th in first read share, but he posted top 12 marks in receiving yards per game (12th-best), yards per route run (seventh), missed tackles forced (third), and yards after the catch per reception (first). Green Bay did feed him an 18.5% designed target rate (second-best among tight ends), but he wasn't the first option on many passing plays.
