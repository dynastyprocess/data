Last week, with Alvin Kamara sustaining an injury, Neal had a 73.8% snap rate with 12 touches and 61 total yards. His passing game usage was noteworthy with seven targets and a 16.2% target share. Neal has yet to register an explosive run or missed tackle this season, but he has had only 17 carries, so we're dealing with a small sample size here. Taysom Hill handled all of the red zone carries for the Saints offense last week, so Neal has some concerns entering this week in regards to his touchdown equity in the offense. Miami's improving run defense is also a worry. Since Week 8, Miami has allowed the third-lowest missed tackle rate, the 13th-fewest yards before contact per attempt, and the fourth-lowest rushing success rate. Neal is a volume play, and if he does score this week, he's likely a low-end RB2. His prospects are more appealing in PPR formats.",NA,NA,"RB26","C+","11.2"

Ayomanor is the WR56 in fantasy points per game with two top-36 finishes this season in weekly scoring, but none since Week 3. Ayomanor has a 16.9% target share with 33.4 receiving yards per game, 1.12 yards per route run, and a 22.2 % first-read share. In his ten games played, he has five red zone targets and ten deep targets. Ayomanor isn't a sexy option, but he's a viable deep league flex play this week.
