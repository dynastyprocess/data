He is an outside corner and had just four solos in the first two weeks of the season, so fantasy managers shouldn't get too excited here. He should be rostered in CB leagues and is worth a tap in deep 16+ team leagues, but should not be anywhere near lineups for Week 4. Look elsewhere for your Week 4 DB3/4 despite the outstanding Week 3 production.","sit",NA,"CB29",NA,"12.5"
