Last week, Walker had 14 carries and 67 rushing yards. Zach Charbonnet finished with the same number of carries, and he and George Holani got into the end zone. Walker tied for the team lead with four red zone rushing attempts and led the way with a 40.7% snap rate, a 30.8% route share, and a 46.2% red zone snap share. In the first half, Walker had a 57.1% snap share while Charbonnet had a 28.6% snap rate inside the 20-yard line. Seattle won't run away with this week's game, so we can cancel out last week's George Holani blip. Based on these numbers, I do think that positive regression is coming for Walker, and it could be this week. Among 64 qualifying backs, Walker ranks seventh in explosive run rate and fifth in missed tackle rate. This week, he faces a Rams run defense that, since Week 6, has allowed the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt, the ninth-highest success rate, the 11th-highest yards per carry to gap runs, the seventh-highest success rate to gap runs, and has logged the 13th-lowest stuff rate. Walker has been the leader for the team in gap run concepts (44.2%). I'm just as worried about Walker disappointing again this week, but the data is quite positive for him this week.

Thomas Jr. has been a tough player to feel confident in this season, much less this week, when he'll be operating at less than 100% in a tough matchup. Thomas is the WR40 in fantasy points per game with one top-24 weekly finish among wide receivers. Thomas has a 20.1% target share with 52.5 receiving yards per game, 1.60 yards per route run, and a 23.9% first-read share. In his eight games played, he has had four red zone targets and 12 deep targets.

Hockenson hasn't finished higher than TE19 in weekly scoring. In those four games, he hasn't managed more than 15 receiving yards in any game and has one red zone target. In this sample, Hockenson has had an 11.1% target share, 0.45 yards per route run, and an 11.6% first-read share. The matchup is nice for Hockenson this week, but I don't know if he'll get the volume to take advantage of it.
