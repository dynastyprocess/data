He finished with 19 touches and 111 total yards as the RB9 for the week. Walker got his first touchdown since Week 3 in the process. Let's have a real conversation, though. It still wasn't great. Walker still only had one red zone rushing attempt, while George Holani (two) and Zach Charbonnet (three) had more work inside the 20-yard line. Walker remains a volatile player. It's not because of talent, but related to his usage still. Since Week 9, he has taken over more of the backfield, though, averaging 15.7 touches and 80.7 total yards with a 48.4% snap rate, a 39% route share, and a 7.5% target share. Since Week 9, he has had more red zone carries (eight) than Charbonnet (seven). Among 54 qualifying backs, Walker ranks fifth in explosive run rate and missed tackle rate. This week's matchup might not be as great as it seems at first glance. Since Week 7, Tennessee has allowed the eighth-most rushing yards per game, the ninth-highest explosive run rate, and the seventh-most yards before contact per attempt. If we zoom in further, it isn't amazing, though. I know it's a small sample, but I have to bring it up. Since Week 9, with Jeffery Simmons (returned in Week 11) and T'Vondre Sweat (returned in Week 7) back, Tennessee has allowed the 11th-fewest rushing yards per game, the third-lowest explosive run rate, zero missed tackles, and the tenth-fewest yards after contact per attempt. We'll see if Tennessee's run defense is as improved as I fear this week. If not, Walker should chew them up.
