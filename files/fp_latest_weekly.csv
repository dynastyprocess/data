He played only 23.3% of the snaps as Jerome Ford took over as the preferred passing-down back. Sampson had only seven touches and 19 total yards. Sampson is a must-sit player this week with a horrible matchup and a worrisome workload projection. We have to see his role increase before considering him as a flex play again. The Packers have an elite run defense this season, holding rushers to zero explosive runs, the second-fewest rushing yards per game, and the fewest yards after contact per attempt.","sit",NA,"RB46","D-","6.2"

Maybe McNichols sees a few less snaps and routes, but I think his usage will be pretty close to this at least until Jacory Croskey-Merritt proves himself on passing downs. McNichols was explosive in limited duty last year. Among 70 qualifying backs, he ranked fourth-best in explosive run rate and 24th in yards after contact per attempt. McNichols could develop into a solid weekly flex play, but this isn't the week to trot him out there in lineups.
