It still only amounted to seven touches (five targets) and 56 total yards (one score) for R.J. Harvey. With the passing game usage and insane touchdown runout over the last two weeks, Harvey has been the RB7 in fantasy points per game. Since Week 4, he has been the RB21 in fantasy points per game. The usage has been volatile but profitable. Since Week 4, he has averaged 8.5 touches and 45.6 total yards per game. Among 62 qualifying backs, he ranks 27th in explosive run rate and 26th in missed tackles forced per attempt. This isn't a good matchup for Harvey through the air, but he could get it done on the ground. The Raiders have allowed the tenth-fewest receiving yards per game and the fourth-lowest yards per reception to running backs. Since Week 5, they haven't given up a ton of huge plays to rushing attacks, but they have allowed the 13th-highest success rate, the eighth-highest missed tackle rate, and the 12th-highest yards after contact per attempt.

It has been a tough season for Jeudy. With Gabriel under center, Jeudy has had a 15.9% target share, 18.8 receiving yards per game, 0.57 yards per route run, and a 21.6% first-read share. In those four games, he has had six red zone targets and two deep targets. Jeudy could have success this week against a secondary that now doesn't include Michael Carter or Sauce Gardner, but Gabriel's lackluster play will still likely cap his production and upside. Jeudy is a dice roll flex play only. Since Week 5, the Jets have ranked 17th in PPR points per target allowed to perimeter wide receivers.",NA,NA,"WR49","C-","8.3"
