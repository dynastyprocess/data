Just for context, if you added just one touchdown to his fantasy production last week, he would have been the RB13 in PPR scoring. The Bucs' run defense has been very hot and cold since Week 9.

He opened this week with a DNP. Washington managed limited practice sessions on Thursday and Friday. He has been listed as questionable for Week 14. Since Week 7, Washington has been the WR30 in fantasy points per game with a 19% target share, 48.7 receiving yards per game, 1.72 yards per route run, and a 22.1% first-read share. In those six games, he has had six red zone targets and six deep targets. Since Week 10, Indy has utilized single high at the sixth-highest rate (62.3%). Since Week 7, against single high, Washington has had a 19.4% target share with 2.12 yards per route run and a 21.9% first-read share. Washington could pay off as a flex play this week, but he has a tough matchup incoming.
