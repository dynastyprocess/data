He directed a passing offense that had the fourth-lowest neutral passing rate and the 15th-slowest neutral pace. The play volume for Darnold isn't likely to be there weekly if this offense continues to operate this way to be anything more than a low-end QB2 unless they fall into a hole and Seattle is forced to pass a ton. Last week, Darnold ranked 17th in yards per attempt, 20th in passer rating, 25th in highly accurate throw rate, and 17th in catchable target rate. Pittsburgh's pass defense was horrible last week. They have too much talent on this side of the ball to continue to look this bad on defense, but I don't know if they'll turn it around this week. Last week, they allowed the third-highest success rate per dropback, the fifth-highest passer rating, and the highest CPOE. If the Steelers truly are this awful again this week, Darnold could see an uptick in his per-dropback efficiency and climb the QB2 ranks.",NA,NA,"QB28","F","14.6"

He faces a Rams' pass defense that last week allowed the 13th-lowest CPOE, the seventh-lowest passer rating, and the ninth-lowest success rate per dropback.

I expect Wilson to be under duress again this week against a Dallas front that led the NFL in pressure rate in Week 1. Wilson might get pulled at some point for Jaxson Dart.

Surprisingly enough, among the same set of quarterbacks, he ranked eighth in highly accurate throw rate. Jones is a decent QB2 play this week, considering the offensive ecosystem and his matchup.

One of the appeals of Kamara in draft season was not only his stable, voluminous role, but his pass game usage and how that would project on a terrible team this season that would be trailing a ton. Well, I guess none of us weighed that Rattler doesn't check down and how that would impact Kamara. I hope this changes, but we'll have to see if it does. Kamara did have a strong 18% missed tackle rate in Week 1, so there's a small sliver of hope for Fantasy GMs. Kamara is likely headed for another down week, and now we have no clue if he'll get the targets to save him.

That is absolutely true, but we still can't run away from this type of volume for any receiver. Brown is tied for the league lead in red zone targets (three). In the second half of Week 1's game, Brown's slot usage increased to 64%, so I think he'll be the primary slot option again this week for Mahomes.

Last week, Fannin Jr. had a 20% target share, 2.17 yards per route run (63 receiving yards), and a 24% first-read share as the TE6 in fantasy. Alright, now it's time for the negative. Fannin Jr. had only a 60.2% route share and a ridiculous 31% target per route run rate. Both of those usage metrics scream regression. It's unlikely that he continues to see a target per route run rate that high, so unless he sees an uptick in routes, his usage is likely to come crashing back to Earth. Cleveland also utilized two tight end sets with 50.7% (second-highest in the NFL) of their offensive plays in Week 1. That's a big difference from their 16.5% (tenth-lowest) snap usage of the same personnel grouping last season. I would sit Fannin Jr. this week to see how his usage shakes out, but I know that's likely not the world that many people are living in after Week 1 with a BEVY of tight end injuries hitting fantasy teams. The matchup and talent are there for this usage to continue for at least one more week. Last year, Baltimore allowed the ninth-most receiving yards, the tenth-highest yards per reception, and the 12th-most fantasy points to tight ends.",NA,NA,"TE15","C-","8.8"
