Olave should have a nice Week 8 against a secondary that has allowed the 13th-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers and ranks 15th in fantasy points per game.

He has five red zone targets and two deep targets over the last two games. This week, he faces a Minnesota pass defense that has the highest two-high rate in the NFL (70.3%). In this small two-game sample, against two high, Gadsden ll has had a 21.4% target share, 2.62 yards per route run, and a 26.7% first-read share.
