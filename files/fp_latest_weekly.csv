Last week, he finally got more involved in the passing attack with a 13.9% target share, 18 receiving yards (0.62 yards per route run), and a 12.5% first-read share. Taylor has one red zone target this season. Taylor dealt with an ankle injury in camp and the preseason, so he could finally be inching closer to 100% which would explain the expanded role in Week 3. Taylor is a strong streaming candidate this week against a defense that has allowed the fourth-most receiving yards, the eighth-highest yards per reception, and the third-most fantasy points per game to tight ends.","start",NA,"TE28","F","5.4"
