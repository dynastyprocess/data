While my pro-Downs prediction came true last week, his route share fell to 57.6%. He has crossed the 70% mark only once this season (Week 5). It's incredibly frustrating, considering his talent, that the Colts are resistant to playing him in a full-time capacity. Overall, he has a 59.1% route share, an 18% target share, 36.2 receiving yards per game (1.85 yards per route run), and a 21.1% first-read share. This week, Downs faces a secondary that, in four of six games, has utilized single high with 51.1-59.4% of their defensive snaps. Against single high, Downs has seen his numbers slightly increase with an 18.8% target share, 2.15 yards per route run, and a 21.4% first-read share. Downs is flex-worthy this week, but I wouldn't expect a repeat of Week 6. The Chargers have allowed the ninth-fewest PPR points per target and the 12th-fewest fantasy points per game (tied) to slot receivers. Downs is now in the concussion protocol. He didn't practice on Wednesday. I'll update his outlook on Friday, but he may miss this week's game.","sit",NA,"WR50","C","8.8"
